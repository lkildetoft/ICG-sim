# ICG-sim
ICG-SIM: A Monte-Carlo simulation of light propagation and fluorescence from  indocyanine-green (ICG) in tissues. Can easily be modified for other fluorophores. Specifically developed to simulate mal-perfusion in the anastomosis after esophagectomy, as such allows for three distinct areas with ICG-concentrations growing at different speeds.
